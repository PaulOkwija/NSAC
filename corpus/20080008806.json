    "abstract": "It is an object of the invention to provide a miniature traveling wave tube which will have most of the advantages of solid state circuitry but with higher efficiency and without being highly sensitive to temperature and various types of electromagnetic radiation and subatomic particles as are solid state devices. The traveling wave tube which is about 2.5 cm in length includes a slow wave circuit (SWS) comprising apertured fins with a top cover which is insulated from the fins by strips or rungs of electrically insulating, dielectric material. Another object of the invention is to construct a SWS of extremely small size by employing various grooving or etching methods and by providing insulating strips or rungs by various deposition and masking techniques."
