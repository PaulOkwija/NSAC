    "abstract": "Under an SBIR contract, EMC Technology, Inc., was funded to develop a family of Temperature Compensating Attenuators. These devices are used to compensate for changes in amplifier gain with temperatures. Special thermistor materials were developed that not only satisfied NASA requirements, but also proved useful on several new commercial products. New Thermopad devices with greater compensation and lower loss were developed and used by companies such as Hughes Space and Communications, Motorola, Lucent, Ericsson, and General Instrument. A Power Sensing Termination (Smartload) was also developed for use in communication systems that require accurate, reliable, low cost power detection for level control and alarm circuits."
